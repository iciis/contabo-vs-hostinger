### Hostinger VPS Key Features

**2. Full Root Access & KVM Virtualization:**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/hostinger">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1P-dDylxb4uYKo5YWbuBHClL0zy2BZt_a" width="800px" alt="">
</a>

Provides complete administrative control with full root access over the server environment. KVM virtualization technology ensures dedicated resources and better server isolation for enhanced stability and performance. 

**3. Automated Backups & Snapshots:**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/hostinger">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Wx6vYIl76R1o3S_0we1XgIbGiPgu9J11" width="800px" alt="">
</a>

Most Hostinger VPS plans include automated weekly backups to safeguard data. Manual live snapshot capabilities are also typically provided, allowing users to create instant restore points before making significant changes.

**4. Dedicated IP Address:**

Each VPS server comes with a dedicated IP address, which is beneficial for email deliverability, security (SSL certificates), and hosting certain types of applications.

**5. AI Assistant & User-Friendly hPanel:**

<a href="https://afftrend.com/hostinger">
  <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=15RzA7U87Q8-zMiu_zz7arvzBPuGmTe2-" width="800px" alt="">
</a>

Hostinger integrates an AI Assistant within its custom hPanel to help users with common VPS management tasks, command generation, and troubleshooting, making it more accessible for less experienced users.

**6. Multiple OS Choices & 1-Click Installers:**

Offers a variety of Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, etc.) and often provides templates or 1-click installers for common applications and control panels like CyberPanel, simplifying setup.

The choice here hinges on priorities. If you need the absolute maximum raw resources (CPU, RAM, enormous storage) for the lowest cost and are comfortable managing it all, Contabo's feature set built around that value is compelling. 

If you prefer a more managed feel with faster storage as standard, user-friendly tools like an AI assistant, and included backups, Hostinger's VPS feature set is designed for greater ease of use and convenience.

The optimal choice between Contabo VPS and Hostinger VPS is highly dependent on your specific project needs and technical comfort. If your main objective is to secure the largest amount of server resources—CPU cores, RAM, and storage—for the lowest possible price, Contabo is hard to beat, especially if you are proficient in server management.

However, if you prioritize a more user-friendly experience, faster NVMe storage as standard, readily available 24/7 support, and bundled features like automated backups and an AI assistant, Hostinger VPS often presents a more convenient and well-rounded package, particularly for those newer to VPS management or looking for a smoother setup process.

Contabo VPS is generally favored by users who are technically experienced, can manage their servers independently, and are looking for the absolute maximum CPU cores, RAM, and storage capacity for the lowest possible price. The trade-off might be in performance consistency (due to shared resources) and less comprehensive support.

Hostinger VPS appeals to a broader audience, including beginners and intermediate users, due to its user-friendly hPanel, inclusive features like automated backups and AI assistance, reliable NVMe performance, and more accessible 24/7 customer support. It strikes a balance between affordability and a more managed, convenient experience.

**FAQs**

**1. What is the main difference between Contabo VPS and Hostinger VPS?**

Contabo VPS focuses on offering the highest possible server resources (CPU, RAM, storage) for the lowest prices, targeting budget-conscious, tech-savvy users. Hostinger VPS aims for a balance of performance (with NVMe SSDs), user-friendliness (hPanel, AI assistant), and included features like automated backups, at competitive prices.

**2. Which VPS provider is cheaper, Contabo or Hostinger?**

Generally, Contabo offers lower prices for a given amount of raw CPU cores and RAM. For instance, a Contabo VPS might offer more vCPUs and RAM for a similar or lower monthly fee than a comparable tier from Hostinger. However, Hostinger's promotional prices can be very attractive for initial terms.
**3. Is Contabo VPS good for beginners?**

Contabo VPS is unmanaged and requires more technical knowledge for setup and maintenance. While affordable, it might be challenging for absolute beginners. Hostinger VPS, with its user-friendly hPanel and AI assistant, is generally considered more beginner-friendly.

**4. Does Hostinger VPS include backups?**

Yes, Hostinger VPS plans typically include automated weekly backups, and some higher-tier plans might offer daily backups. Manual snapshots are also usually available. Contabo offers snapshot capabilities, but comprehensive backup solutions are often manual or add-on services like their FTP backup space.

**5. Which provider offers better VPS performance?**

Hostinger VPS plans typically use NVMe SSDs as standard, which generally offer better I/O performance than standard SSDs or HDDs. Contabo offers both NVMe and standard SSD options; their NVMe plans are performant, but overall shared VPS performance can vary. For consistent NVMe speed, Hostinger is a strong contender.

**6. Can I get Windows VPS from both Contabo and Hostinger?**

Contabo explicitly offers Windows VPS plans for an additional license fee. Hostinger's self-managed KVM VPS primarily focuses on Linux distributions; while technically possible to install Windows on a KVM VPS with your own license, it's not a standard, directly supported offering like Contabo's.

**7. What kind of customer support can I expect?**

Hostinger offers 24/7 customer support via live chat and email, along with an extensive knowledge base and AI assistant, generally receiving positive reviews for responsiveness. Contabo offers support via email and phone (during EU business hours), with user experiences varying more.

**8. If I need a lot of storage space on my VPS, who is better?**

Contabo excels here with its "Storage VPS" line, offering multi-terabyte SSD options at very competitive prices. While Hostinger offers decent NVMe storage, Contabo's specialized storage plans provide significantly more capacity for the cost.

**9. Are there control panel options with these VPS?**

Contabo allows the installation of cPanel or Plesk for an additional license fee. Hostinger VPS plans can be managed via their custom hPanel (which includes many control panel-like functions) and also support the installation of other control panels like CyberPanel (often with templates).

**10. Which VPS is better for running multiple websites?**

Both can host multiple websites. Contabo's high resource allocations for the price might allow you to host more sites on a single server if you manage resources efficiently. Hostinger's ease of management and reliable performance make it a solid choice for hosting multiple sites with less hands-on server tuning.

## **Conclusion**

In the Contabo vs Hostinger comparison, both hosts serve different user priorities. Contabo offers more server resources at lower prices, ideal for developers or users needing high storage and RAM.

Hostinger, however, excels in user experience, offering faster loading speeds, a beginner-friendly interface, and excellent customer support, perfect for small businesses or personal websites.

If performance and affordability are your main goals, Contabo provides strong value, especially for VPS hosting. But if you prioritize ease of use and global speed optimization, Hostinger is a better fit.

Ultimately, your choice depends on your hosting goals. For technical users with resource-heavy projects, Contabo is a strong contender. For beginners or entrepreneurs focused on speed and support, Hostinger is more suitable.
